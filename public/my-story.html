                <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is David! This is how I became a sought-after photo retoucher, working on over ten thousand pictures for studios across different continents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Picture this: a little boy, around 7 or 8 years old, watching his older brother struggle with Photoshop. "This is easy," I thought. I watched, hoping to be asked to try. When the opportunity came, I handled it like an expert (kidding… but not really—I did it better than him). Little did I know, I was onto something bigger.
                </p>

                <h3>Finding My Path</h3>
                <p>
                    Fast forward to 2021, I had just finished secondary school at Federal Government College, Ikot Ekpene. Sadly, my dad passed away before my graduation, and I had to miss the ceremony for his funeral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I later traveled to stay with my aunt to prepare for my post-UTME. My JAMB score (61) was just shy of the cutoff (around 70)—painful! But this setback gave me time to learn a skill. Visiting a friend at a photography studio reignited my passion. My uncle funded my training at CFAT Studios in Aba, and my journey truly began.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-section">
                <h3>The Hustle Begins</h3>
                <p>
                    Learning wasn’t easy. Every day, I trekked long distances to the studio to save my transport fare for snacks later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After months, I felt I had outgrown the studio. I applied for internships at bigger studios and eventually landed an interview at Vicky Henry Studios. After an intense interview and a test, the boss took me in—no salary at first, but he covered some transport expenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I edited 10–15 pictures daily. It pushed me to master retouching. After eight months, my boss even asked me to stay and study in Aba, but I had bigger plans—Film Production at Obafemi Awolowo University, Great Ife!

                <h3>The Breakthrough Moment</h3>
                <p>
                    Weeks before resumption, I worked on a model’s RAW image from Detty Studios. It took me 3–4 days to perfect. I posted it on Facebook, hoping for feedback. The response was insane—thousands of likes, hundreds of comments, and tons of shares!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had been underrating myself. Job offers poured in, and photographers from across Africa and beyond wanted to work with me. That moment changed everything.

                <h3>Lessons from My Journey</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Never be idle. Find something to do; it pays off.</li>
                    <li>Step out of your comfort zone. Growth happens when you're challenged.</li>
                    <li>Never stop learning. The moment you think you've "arrived," you stop progressing.</li>
                    <li>Put your work out there. Get feedback, improve, and take the praise when it’s due.</li>
                    <li>Your breakthrough will come. Stay consistent—you never know when it’ll happen.</li>
                </ul>
